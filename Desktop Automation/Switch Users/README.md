# Switch Users
Desktop automation that:
- Switch discord users from my brother to me
- Switch mic from 'RTX Voice' that brother uses to 'XIBERIA' headset that I use for mic
- Change mouse sensitivity from brother's settings to mine (Glorious Model O Software application)
- Closes select background processes

# Ideas for future updates
- Close all open applications that brother left open
- Open Google Chrome and select my google profile user
- Close extra desktops that are open

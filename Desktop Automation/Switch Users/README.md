# Switch Users
Desktop automation that:
- Switch discord users from my brother to me
- Change mouse sensitivity from brother's settings to mine (Glorious Model O Software application)

# Ideas for future updates
- Close all open applications, besides Discord
- Open Google Chrome and select my google profile user
- Close applications running in the background
- Close extra desktops that are open

# Seasonal Anime Update Checker
User inputs which animes they would like to keep a track of and how many episodes they have seen, the checker will then check if a new episode has been released that the user has not watched yet and alert the user that a enw episode has come out for the seasonal anime. The checker will use 9anime.to to check for the animes and their episodes.
